# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until the project reaches a stable (1.x.x) status, no versions of Pebble
should be considered 'supported', as most of the project will be very fluid
until APIs are frozen.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in the project, please advise both security@resf.org
_and_ web@resf.org (with a CC or similar) of it so that the issue can be quickly
resolved without being publicly announced.
